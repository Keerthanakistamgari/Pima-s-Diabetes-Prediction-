🩺 PIMA’s Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
📘 Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient is diabetic or not based on medical diagnostic measurements from the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset.
The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early diabetes detection using data-driven insights powered by Machine Learning.

🎯** Objectives**

Analyze patient health data to identify patterns related to diabetes.

Build and evaluate multiple ML models for accurate prediction.

Deploy a reliable and interpretable model for healthcare applications.
